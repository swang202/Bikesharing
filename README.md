# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview:

In order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal,
we performed bike trip analysis using NYC Citibike data and created a set of visualizations as a story. We analyse the length of time that bikes are checked out, the number of bike trips at each hour of the days, and the type of users, for all riders and by genders.

## Results:

- Most of the trips are under 1 hour, with a peak of travel during around 5 mins, regardless of gender.
- During Weekdays, the uses of the bikes are higher in the morning (7-9AM) and the late afternoon (4-7PM), while in weekends, bike usages are spread out through out the day. No much difference were shown between genders.
- More people using the bike are subscribers.
- There are more male users compare to female users.

## Summary:

We added new visualization story and created story based on analysis. More detailed information can be find in: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shijie1183/viz/CitibikeChallenge_16375674195710/Story1?publish=yes 'citibike story')
